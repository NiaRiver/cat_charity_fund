# QRKot Charity Fund

QRKot is a FastAPI-based application for a cat charity foundation that helps manage and track donations for various cat-support projects.

## Description

The QRKot Foundation collects donations for various targeted projects aimed at supporting cats, including:
- Medical services for cats in need
- Setting up cat colonies
- Food for abandoned cats
- Other cat population support initiatives

## Features

### Projects
- Multiple charity projects can be active simultaneously
- Each project has a name, description, and target amount
- Projects are automatically closed once the target amount is reached
- Projects follow FIFO (First In, First Out) principle for receiving donations
- Donations are automatically invested in the earliest opened project

### Donations
- Users can make donations with optional comments
- Donations are not project-specific and go to the common fund
- Donations are automatically distributed to open projects
- Excess donations are held for future projects

### User Roles
- **Anonymous Users**: Can view all projects
- **Registered Users**: Can make donations and view their donation history
- **Administrators**: Can create projects, delete unfunded projects, and modify existing projects
